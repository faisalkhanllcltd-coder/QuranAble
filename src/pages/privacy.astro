    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <span class="meta-date">Last Updated: February 2026</span>
    
    <p>At <strong>QuranAble</strong>, accessible from quranable.com, the privacy of our visitors and students is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected by QuranAble and how it is used, safeguarded, and shared.</p>
    <p>This policy applies globally and complies with major international data protection regulations. By using our website, participating in our classes, or interacting with our digital advertisements, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & Registration Data:</strong> When you register for a free trial or enroll in a course, we may ask for your contact information, including items such as your name, parent/guardian name, email address, telephone number, and time zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Student Assessment Data:</strong> To provide tailored education, we collect details regarding the student's age, gender (for tutor matching), current reading level, and specific educational goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> For premium enrollments, payment information is processed securely through compliant third-party processors (such as Stripe). <em>QuranAble does not store your credit card numbers on our servers.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Technical & Usage Data:</strong> When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and interaction with our website pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our educational platform and live classes.</li>
      <li>Assign appropriate male or female tutors based on your preferences.</li>
      <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our curriculum and website usability.</li>
      <li>Understand and analyze how you use our website to enhance user experience.</li>
      <li>Process your transactions and send related information, including scheduling confirmations and invoices.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you directly for customer service, academic progress updates, and promotional purposes.</li>
      <li>Find and prevent fraud or unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Advertising</h2>
    <p>Like any other professional website, QuranAble uses "cookies". These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. This allows us to optimize the user experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Partners:</strong> We utilize third-party tracking technologies, including the <strong>Meta Pixel (Facebook/Instagram)</strong> and <strong>Google Analytics / Google Ads tags</strong>. These third-party vendors use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve ads based on your past visits to our website. This is known as "remarketing."</p>
    <p>These third-party ad servers receive your IP address automatically when this occurs. They use this data to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see on websites that you visit. <em>QuranAble has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.</em></p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Privacy Policies & Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information with our business partners.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video Conferencing:</strong> Zoom or similar platforms used to conduct our live 1-on-1 sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> Stripe or PayPal for secure tuition billing.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Tools:</strong> Email service providers and WhatsApp API for scheduling and reminders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>QuranAble's Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. Because we offer Quranic education for children, we require explicit parental or legal guardian consent to collect data necessary for tutoring (such as the child's age, first name, and learning level).</p>
    <p>We never market directly to children. All communications, billing, and scheduling are directed solely to the parent or guardian. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website without your consent, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately, and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our site. Data exchange between the website and its users happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted.</p>
    <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or as required by legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>7. GDPR and CCPA Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Depending on your jurisdiction, you are entitled to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Privacy Team.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
