    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <span class="meta-date">Last Updated: February 2026</span>
    
    <p>Welcome to QuranAble. By accessing our website (quranable.com) or using our online educational platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service. Please read these terms carefully before enrolling in any courses.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Provision & Technical Requirements</h2>
    <p>QuranAble provides live, 1-on-1 online Quranic tutoring via third-party video conferencing software (such as Zoom). To use our services, students must have access to a stable internet connection, a functioning webcam, and a microphone.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the service, curriculum, or platform functionality at any time without prior notice. QuranAble is not liable for missed classes caused by the student's local internet outages or hardware malfunctions.</p>

    <h2>2. Registration and Account Security</h2>
    <p>When registering for an account or a free trial, you agree to provide accurate and current information. If the student is under the age of 18, a parent or legal guardian must create the account and manage all billing and scheduling.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. QuranAble will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your login information.</p>

    <h2>3. User Conduct & Code of Adab (Etiquette)</h2>
    <p>The pursuit of Quranic knowledge requires utmost respect. Students and parents are expected to maintain a respectful environment (Adab) toward our tutors and staff at all times.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modesty:</strong> Students are required to dress modestly during live video sessions, in accordance with Islamic principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Classes should be taken in a quiet, distraction-free room.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero Tolerance:</strong> Any form of harassment, inappropriate language, discrimination, or abuse toward our tutors will result in immediate termination of the account without a refund.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Attendance, Cancellations & Makeup Classes</h2>
    <p>Punctuality is crucial for the success of our educational programs. The following attendance rules apply strictly to all active students:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Late Arrivals:</strong> Tutors will wait in the virtual classroom for 15 minutes. If a student is more than 15 minutes late, the class is marked as "Absent" and is forfeited.</li>
      <li><strong>Student Cancellations:</strong> If a student needs to cancel or reschedule a class, they must provide at least 24 hours' notice to the administration. Classes canceled with less than 24 hours' notice will not be compensated or made up.</li>
      <li><strong>Tutor Cancellations:</strong> If a tutor is absent or experiences a technical failure, QuranAble will provide a makeup class at a mutually agreed-upon time or provide a substitute tutor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Payments and Subscription Billing</h2>
    <p>By enrolling in a paid course, you agree to our recurring billing terms. Tuition fees are billed automatically on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, depending on the plan you select at checkout.</p>
    <p>All payments are processed securely via our payment gateways (e.g., Stripe). If a recurring payment fails, QuranAble reserves the right to suspend classes until the outstanding balance is settled. Prices are subject to change, but existing students will be notified at least 30 days in advance of any price modifications.</p>

    <h2>6. Refunds and Account Termination</h2>
    <p>Students or parents may cancel their subscription at any time to prevent future billing. Cancellation requests must be made prior to the next billing cycle date.</p>
    <p>For detailed information regarding money-back guarantees, trial periods, and eligibility for refunds, please refer to our dedicated Refund Policy. All refund requests must be directed to our billing team at <a href="mailto:refund@quranable.com" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">refund@quranable.com</a>.</p>

You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from our materials without express written consent.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, QuranAble shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, our services.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with standard international business laws, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from these terms will be resolved through amicable negotiation or, if necessary, standard legal arbitration.</p>
