    <p>At QuranAble (quranable.com), we believe in being transparent about how we collect and use data related to you. This Cookie Policy provides detailed, comprehensive information about how and when we use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to improve our educational platform and deliver relevant advertising globally.</p>

    <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer, smartphone, or other digital devices by your web browser when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, provide secure login sessions, and supply tracking information to the owners of the site.</p>

    <h2>2. How and Why We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best possible experience on our platform. The cookies we use fall into the following critical categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These are essential for our website to function properly. They allow you to navigate our site, access secure student portals, and process payments securely via Stripe. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance & Analytics Cookies:</strong> We use tools like Google Analytics to collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website. This helps us understand which educational articles, landing pages, and course descriptions are most helpful, allowing us to continuously improve our platform's user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your preferred language, timezone, or login details) to provide a more personalized and seamless experience during your online classes.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting & Advertising Cookies:</strong> We use third-party tracking technologies, including the <strong>Meta Pixel (Facebook/Instagram)</strong> and <strong>Google Ads tags</strong>, to deliver relevant advertisements to you on other websites. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed. This practice, known as remarketing, helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns globally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the service, deliver advertisements on and through the service, and authenticate users. Our trusted partners include:</p>

      <li><strong>Meta (Facebook/Instagram):</strong> Used to measure ad conversions and build custom audiences for remarketing our Quranic courses.</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Used strictly for secure payment processing and fraud prevention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Choices: Managing Your Preferences</h2>
    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can manage or disable cookies at any time by modifying your web browser controls.
